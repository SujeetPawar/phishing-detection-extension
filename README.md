# Phishing Detection Extension

This is a Chrome extension designed to collect and display all links from a webpage. It will eventually be integrated with a phishing detection machine learning model to check the safety of each link.

## Features

- **Link Collection**: Automatically collects all links (`<a>` tags) from the currently active tab.
- **Display Links**: Displays the collected links in a popup window.
